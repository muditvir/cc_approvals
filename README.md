# Credit Card Approval Prediction

This project implements a **machine learning pipeline** to predict whether a credit card application will be approved based on applicant details.  
The model is trained using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm, with preprocessing steps to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numeric features.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is **`cc_approvals.data`**, which contains applicant details such as age, income, credit history, and more.  
Some values are missing (represented as `?`), which are handled during preprocessing.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Read dataset into Pandas DataFrame  
   - Generate summary statistics and check data types  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Replace missing values with mean (for numeric) or mode (for categorical)  
   - Encode categorical features using **Label Encoding**  
   - Drop irrelevant columns (11 and 13)  
   - Scale features using **MinMaxScaler**  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Train a **Logistic Regression** model  
   - Evaluate with accuracy score and confusion matrix  

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Use **GridSearchCV** to find best `tol` and `max_iter` values

## ðŸ“Š Results
- The model achieves an accuracy of **84%**.
